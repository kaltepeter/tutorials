# Notes

## Section 3

### Responsive Design

- fixed design: the worst
- adaptive design: condensing by proportion
  - separate stylesheet for each device/size
- responsive design: best user experience
  - fluid design
  - renders elements based on screen size
  - uses media queries

Best Practices

- relative units: %, rem, em, vh, vw
- media queries: material ui uses hooks for media queries
- grid system
- testing

Breakpoints

Using down makes it easy to understand with layering.

`xs`: most phones
`s`: phones in landscape, tablets
`md`tablets in landscape

Material UI

If you need to override styles, first check the API for props that override.

## Section 4

Grid

- Uses flex box
