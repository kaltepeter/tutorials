# Notes

This course is amazing. I had a bit of trouble going from Angular Material to React Material UI since they are so different. I highly recommend purchasing this course to really understand how to use Material UI for React.

## Section 3

### Responsive Design

- fixed design: the worst
- adaptive design: condensing by proportion
  - separate stylesheet for each device/size
- responsive design: best user experience
  - fluid design
  - renders elements based on screen size
  - uses media queries

Best Practices

- relative units: %, rem, em, vh, vw
- media queries: material ui uses hooks for media queries
- grid system
- testing

Breakpoints

Using down makes it easy to understand with layering.

`xs`: most phones
`s`: phones in landscape, tablets
`md`tablets in landscape

Material UI

If you need to override styles, first check the API for props that override.

## Section 4

Grid

- Uses flex box

Lol, href (har-ef) pronunciation

`component` in material can be a plain html component if in quotes. I had no idea

## Section 5

Animations, covers a whole process using after effects and bodymovin to produce the files.

Uses [Lottie](https://github.com/chenqingspring/react-lottie) to display.

Lottie takes a json to svg.

Really focused on responsive design at various breakpoints.

He uses a lot of inline styles which I don't care for, however, it appears to solve the problem of overriding styles with JSX styles.

`ctrl + command + space` in mac opens emoji window.
